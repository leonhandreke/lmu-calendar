# LMU Calendar

A web service that makes the calendar generated by the
[LMU](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/) [LSF system](http://lsf.verwaltung.uni-muenchen.de)
easily subscribable in e.g. Google Calendar. It achieves this by giving the
calendar a stable URL and including the username and password in the GET
parameters.

## Usage

I run a public instance of this service at `http://lmu-calendar.ndreke.de`. The
URL for your calendar is constructed as follows:
`http://lmu-calendar.ndreke.de/stundenplan/<semester_id>?username=<myusername>&password=<mypassword>`.
`semester_id` is the year concatenated with `1` for Sommersemester and `2` for
Wintersemester. So e.g. `20172` means Wintersemester 2017/2018, `20181` means
Sommersemester 2018.

You're welcome to run your own instance as well, there is plenty of
documentation online on how to run a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)-based
service.

## Security

Transmitting your username and password through GET parameters in an
unencrypted connection to an untrusted server (i.e. mine) is obviously really
insecure. Deal with it and consider your account compromised. I'll do my best
to keep your credentials private though (which doesn't mean a lot).
